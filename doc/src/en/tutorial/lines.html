Steps and driplines
Difficult styles
lines_lines.png

Two line styles very important for cave maps - dripline and step - are in
fact very difficult to render in Inkscape. This is because SVG does not
provide an easy way to add perpendicular ticks to a line.

Caveink provides a way around.

First step line
lines_path.png

Draw a path using the Pen/Bezier tool (B). Select it and go to <i>Extensions
/ Speleo / Symbols / Path to step</i>. Configure <i>Font size: 6</i>,
<i>Line thickness: 0.2</i>, <i>Line type: minor step</i>. Click
<i>Apply</i>.

A neat step line will appear. For your next lines, you can use a keyboard
shortcut, Alt+1, if only Caveink keyboard bindings were properly installed.

Editing the line

Switch to the node tool (N) and click on our new line. Standard path handles
will appear and let you edit the line. Step ticks should neatly follow,
as you change the shape. Select <i>Path / Reverse</i> to switch the side on
which the ticks protrude.

Caveats
lines_trick.png

Unfortunately, this line style is in fact a little trick. Your line consists
of two distinct objects - your original path and the ticks. The ticks are
linked to the path and usually follow it. If you edit or move the path,
ticks should automatically update.

There is one nasty limitation of this method. If you copy and paste or otherwise
duplicate the line, the copied ticks stay linked to the original path.
Everything seems fine, until you edit the copied path. The ticks no longer
follow and it looks bad.

There is help
lines_fix.png

If you end up in such situation, you have two choices. If it is only one
line, you may select it and re-style via Alt+1 (or <i>Extensions / Speleo / Symbols /
Path to step</i>). The broken ticks will be deleted. 

If you have many broken lines to fix (eg. after importing one file into
another), it might be quicker to use <i>Extensions / Speleo / Symbols /
Repair file</i>. This action finds and regenerates broken links throughout the whole
document.

Zombie ticks
lines_zombie.png

If you accidentaly delete only the path object, but leave the ticks in
place, you might end up with <i>zombie ticks</i> on your drawing. These annoying
artifacts neither are linked to any path, nor can be selected for deletion.

The easiest way to get rid of them is to do <i>Extensions / Speleo / Symbols /
Repair file</i>.
---
Dripline
lines_drip.png

Let's go back to positive news. A dripline is made as easy as a step. Just
draw a path using the Pen tool (B), select it and press Alt+2 (or go to
<i>Extensions / Speleo / Symbols / Path to dripline</i>).

All remarks above apply.
