Generating grids and scale bars
So, your drawing is ready?

Now that we have our map ready, it is time to lay it out for a nice PDF export.

Obviously, before preparing a legend, it would be nice to have a grid and
a scalebar.

Grid options

Lets' go to <i>Extensions / Speleo / Generate / Render grid...</i>. 

You need to tell the extension the scale of your drawing and decide whether
you want the coordinates printed where the grid lines end or not. The X-axis
coordinates can be rotated 90 degrees.

There are actually two styles of grid available - one is a traditional,
rectangular grid. The other one (<i>Crosses</i>) is a minimalistic grid,
without lines, but rather just small crosses printed out at grid
intersections.

Click <i>Apply</i>.

Getting it right

By default, the grid covers the whole page and coordinates start at top
left corner of the page. This is most often not what we need.

Lets' adjust the grid origin point first. Delete the grid.
Open <i>Object / Symbols</i> and select the <i>Cave plan</i> symbol set.
Drag a station symbol onto your drawing and place it where (0, 0) should 
actually be.

Better origin

Make sure the symbol is selected (dashed lines and transformation handles
around). Run <i>Extensions / Speleo / Generate / Render grid...</i> again.
Adjust <i>Origin X</i> and <i>Origin Y</i> if it is not really (0, 0) that
should be where the station symbol is. Click <i>Apply</i>.

It is almost good, but in our example we actually do not want the grid to
fill all the page. As a matter of fact, we need two grids - one for the
plan and other for the elevation drawing.

Confine the grid

Delete the grid again. Now draw a rectangle defining an area where the grid
should appear. Select <i>both</i> that rectangle and the station symbol that
we used to indicate the origin point.

Re-run the grid extension (you can simply use <i>Extensions / Previous
extension</i> or Alt+Q).

Almost good

Now it is much better, but perhaps you would rather have the lines in red?
Simply select the grid object and go to <i>Fill and Stroke</i>. You can
adjust line color in the <i>Stroke paint</i> tab and coordinate color in
<i>Fill</i>.

Making it perfect

The grid is a simple group, containing groups of lines and text inside. You
can ungroup it by hitting Ctrl+U twice and re-work it.

For example, you may want to select all the grid elements, use the <i>Node</i>
tool to select a couple of line ends and then drag them together with Ctrl held
so that they are shorter.

Another trick is to select one of the coordinate captions, right-click it
and choose <i>Select same / Object type</i>. After that, going to <i>Text /
Text and font...</i> will let you adjust font size and font face for the
coordinates.

Adding a scalebar

Generating scalebars is even easier. Simply go to <i>Extensions / Speleo /
Generate / Render scalebar...</i>. Again, you need to tell Inkcave what
scale are you drawing in.

Again, you can go to <i>Object / Fill and stroke</i> to adjust colors of
your scalebar.
