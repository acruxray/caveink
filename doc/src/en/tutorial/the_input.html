Importing PocketTopo sketches into Inkscape
File formats
the_pockettopo.png

Caveink does not read <i>top</i> files directly. In order to import a
PocketTopo sketch, you first need to run PocketTopo and convert it into a
Therion export file.

Load your <i>top</i> file in PocketTopo and select <i>File / Export /
Therion...</i>. Choose a file name and click <i>Save</i>.

Renaming

Unfortunately, we are still not ready. Inkscape will only recognize the file
after you <i>change its extension</i>.

Go to the folder you saved the file in. The export file name should end with
<i>.txt</i>. Rename it, so that it ends with <i>.the</i> 

If you do not see the <i>.txt</i> suffix in the first place, it can indicate
that your operating system hides the extensions from you. If you are using
Windows, you might want to reconfigure your <i>Folder options</i>. While
browsing files in the folder, look for a menu option to change
<i>Folder and search options</i> (for example, in in Windows 10 it is in
the <i>View</i> tab of the window). After opening the options window,
go to <i>View</i> and uncheck <i>Hide extensions for known file types</i>.

Importing

You can now import the drawing into Inkscape by using <i>File /
Import...</i>. Simply select the <i>.the</i> file. A window with a couple of
options should appear. As a starting point, select <i>View: Plan</i>,
<i>Scale 1:500</i> and <i>Station symbols: Triangles (as Markers)</i>. Tick
<i>Draw Station names</i> and unselect <i>Draw splay shots</i>.

Note that there is also an option to import Projected elevation. In
PocketTopo you actually draw an extended profile, so it requires some
processing. Due to geometric realities, do not expect miracles from this
conversion - it will only work for projection planes not very off from the
extended elevation plane.
