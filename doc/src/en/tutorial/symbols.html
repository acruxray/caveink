Caveink symbol library
Basic usage
symbols_basic.png

Select <i>Object / Symbols...</i> from the drop-down menu to open the symbol
library. You need to switch the <i>Symbol set</i> into <i>Cave plan</i> in
order to see the cave map symbols.

Simply drag the symbol you need from the library onto your drawing. After
you place the symbol, you can easily duplicate it by dragging it around your
map and hitting Space (with your left mouse button pressed all the time).

Rock symbols

Change the <i>Symbol set</i> to <i>Cave rocks</i> to open a library of
variously shaped rocks and pebbles. They come in five different sizes, every
size featuring ten shapes.

Mixing rocks

Suppose you would like to indicate that there are a few rocks lying around in some
particular place in the cave. The easiest way to do it is to get one rock
from the symbol library and copy it around using the spacebar trick.

However, it would look much nicer if the rocks were not identical. 

Of course you can hand-pick a couple of different rocks from the rock library
and even rotate some of them so that there is even more variety. But there
is an easier way: caveink provides a rock mixer for you!

Select your rocks

Simply select your rocks and choose <i>Extensions / Speleo / Symbols /
Randomize rocks</i>. 

If you installed the <i>caveink</i> keyboard shortcuts, instead of going
into the menu you can also press Alt+3.

Mixed rock

The rocks will get randomly rotated and replaced. Note that rock dimensions
and type (rock/pebble) are preserved!

Beware of rocks

Rocks are very dangerous. Also on your drawing. Too many individual rocks will cause
your drawing to be very inconvenient to work on. If your whole cave is
filled with rock debris, consider using <a
href="tutorial_patterns.html">fill patterns</a> that caveink provides.

With patterns, instead of placing hundreds of rocks, you simply define an
area and tell <i>inkscape</i> to fill it with a particular rock type.

Gray and unstyled rocks
symbols_rocks_gray.png

There are some disadvantages of rock pattern fills. Currently, due to the
way scaling works in SVG files, it is difficult for caveink to provide you
with patterns of stroked rocks (ie. rock outlines - like the basic rock
symbols). The shapes representing rocks in the patterns have a solid gray or
black fill instead. 

If you use the patterns, you might still find yourself in a need to place
one or two individual rock symbols somewhere on the drawing. You can be
consistent with the patterns by using rocks from the <i>Cave rocks -
Gray</i> and <i>Cave rocks - Unstyled</i>. Remember to use 
<i>Object / Fill and Stroke</i> and set your desired color and line style
for the unstyled ones.

Scaling symbols
symbols_scaling.png

By default, in SVG files line width gets scaled along with the objects. This
is not always desired when scaling symbols. If you ever need to scale a symbol,
it is recommended to use its unstyled version from either <i>Cave symbols -
unstyled</i> or <i>Cave rocks - Unstyled</i> symbol set. You can then use 
<i>Object / Fill and Stroke</i> to adjust the stroke width and even the
symbol color as you see fit.
