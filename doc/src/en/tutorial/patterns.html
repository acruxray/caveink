Patterns for area fills
The problem
patterns_specific_rocks.png

Rocks on cave plans come in different kinds. There is angular debris and
pebbles. There are small rocks, large rocks and boulders. Last, but not
least, there are specific and unspecific rocks.

Suppose my cave is filled with mud all the way and has three small
rocks sitting under a tall chimney. I would note the exact position of these
rocks and place exactly three rock symbols on my cave map, even trying to
draw them in proportion to their relative size and depict their shape.
These are specific rocks - the symbol on the plan is strictly related to
a particular rock in the cave. Probably I would not even be using the
stock rocks. 

On the other hand, if all the cave is filled with debris, I usually do not
care about particular rocks. The rock symbols on the plan only indicate that
there is a lot of debris and do not symbolize individual rocks that you can
pick and compare with the symbol.

Rocks are dangerous

You can cope with unspecific rocks in a couple of ways. One of them is to
copy rock symbols around many times. It is in fact not a good way, because
it takes a lot of time and will slow down inkscape on your drawing in the
long run. This is because you can easily end up with hundreds of distinct
rock objects, each with its own shape and rotation, that will take a lot of
effort for your computer to render.

Lets' do it in a better way, using pattern fills.
---
Mark your area

First, define a closed shape defining the area to be filled with rocks. You
can fill it with color for the time being, to see better. 
---
Choose your pattern
patterns_fillstroke.png

Now go to <i>Object / Fill and stroke</i>. Select <i>Fill</i> tab and click
on the <i>Pattern</i> icon at the top of the tab. Select <i>rocks_medium</i>
as the filling pattern.
---
Adjust rock size

Suppose you actually needed smaller rocks. Activate the <i>Node</i> tool
(press N) and select your area. Note that in addition to regular node
handles (marked points that you can use to alter your shape), there should
be an extra set of three handles somewhere on your canvas - a cross, a
circle and a square. Beware, they can sometimes display in an unexpected
place.

These handles control the pattern fill. Now hold Ctrl, grab the square handle 
and move it around. Your rocks will neatly change sizes.
---
Pattern stacking
patterns_stacking.png

What if in the middle of your area there is larger debris along with the
small rocks? No problem! Draw another shape on top of the original area and
apply pattern fill again. Adjust the inner area using Node tool, so that the
rocks in there are bigger.

---
Density
patterns_density.png

Note that each pattern comes in three densities: sparse/medium/dense. You
can overlay two sparse areas to get somewhere in between sparse and medium.
---
Outlined rocks
patterns_outline.png

As you surely noticed, the rocks have a solid fill, rather than being an
outline with a white fill. This is because of a small disadvantage of
pattern fills: the pattern is always sharply cut at the defining shape edges. As
you can see on the nearby illustration, sharply cut outlines do not look
nice.
---
Gray patterns
patterns_gray.png

Black, solid filled rocks can make your other symbols indistinct. Because of
that, all of the rock patterns have a gray version. Consider using them
instead.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to specify a custom fill color for the
pattern.
---
Gray rocks
symbols_rocks_gray.png

If you decide to use pattern fills and go for the filled-in rocks, you
probably will be happy to stay consistent with this convention when placing
specific rocks on the drawing.

Obviously, it also makes more sense to just draw a couple of symbols for unspecific
rocks in very small areas, rather than fill them with a pattern. It can be difficult
to get your pattern right for just two, three or four rock symbols that you want
appear in a particular place.

To save time, you can simply use <i>Cave rocks - Gray</i> symbol set from  <i>Object /
Symbols</i>. After you place a rock, rotate and scale it as you see fit.

---
Other patterns
patterns_other.png

Note that there are also patterns for filling areas with silt, clay, sand,
gravel and pebbles. They are all used in a very similar manner. 
---
Pattern template
patterns_palette.png

It can be a little frustrating to get the pattern right, especially with the
debris patterns. If you don't mind switching to another Inkscape window from
time to time, you can invoke <i>File / Templates...</i> and select <i>Cave
symbols palette</i>, which is a SVG document containing - among other useful
things - dozens of rectangles with various pattern fills.

Once you find a pattern that suits you there, simply copy the rectangle to
clipboard, switch to your cave plan, select a shape and invoke <i>Edit /
Paste style</i> (Ctrl + Shift + V)

Note that copying patterns around with <i>Paste style</i> 
will make your document large over time, as Inkscape in fact duplicates
patterns instead of referencing them many times. Use 
<i>Extensions / Speleo / Symbols / Repair file</i> and then <i>File / Clean up
document</i> to remove redundant copies after you finish your drawing.

Enjoy the patterns!
