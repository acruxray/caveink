Find and replace symbols
The problem
find_mislayered.png

Suppose that for some reason you wanted all your speleothems groupped in a
separate layer. Unfortunately, you discover that you put them in all
possible layers, probably not being careful enough when placing them.

Now lets' quickly move all the stalactites to one layer and make them brown!

Select symbol(s) to find

First, select any of the stalactites in any of the layers.

Run the extension

Now go to <i>Extensions / Speleo / Symbols / Find and replace ...</i>. Make
sure <i>Group found symbols together</i> is checked. Select <i>Stalactite
(unstyled)</i> next to <i>Replace with</i>. Click <i>Apply</i>.

Move the group into proper layer

Again, click on any of the stalactites. Now, a whole group consisting of all
stalactites found in visible layers should become selected. Click in the
same place, but with right mouse button this time. Select <i>Move to
layer...</i> and choose your desired layer (in this example, <i>Decoration</i>).

Apply styling

With the group still selected, go to <i>Object / Fill and stroke</i>. Decide
for a color in the <i>Stroke paint</i> tab. Set stroke width to <i>0.15
mm</i> in <i>Stroke style</i>.
