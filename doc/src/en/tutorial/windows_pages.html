Splitting big drawings into pages
The problem
pages_overview.png

Of course you can split big drawings into separate pages manually, even putting
each of the pages in separate files. However, you can end up with a lot of work
if you need to update your map - for example, add some newly discovered passages
that span many pages. It is even worse if you prepared the pages so that they
slightly overlap for the reader's convenience.

With Caveink, you can keep working on the original drawing independently of
the final layout and make all the pages refer to it, so that they update
automatically as the drawing is edited.

Preparations
pages_preparations.png

Before invoking Caveink functions, we need some preparations. We are going
to keep everything in one file. Since the SVG format does not support
multiple pages per file, we are going to completely ignore the SVG page
area. In order not to be distracted by the page frame, go to <i>File /
Document properties</i> and uncheck <i>Show page border</i>.

Layer structure
pages_layers.png

In order for this trick to work, you have to keep the original drawing in its own
layer. Let's name it <i>Drawing</i>. This layer should not have any objects directly
in it, but rather contain all the contents in sub-layers (such as, for example,
<i>Outline</i>, <i>Details</i> etc.).

On the other hand, we are going create a separate layer for each page that
we want exported. The pages can be groupped together in another layer (say,
<i>Pages</i>).

If it does not sound clear, see the example file (<a href="files/pages.svg">pages.svg</a>).

Draw a page frame

Go to the <i>Drawing</i> layer. Draw a rectangle over your drawing
denoting what the first page should contain. You can use the controls just
below the Inkscape menu bar to configure exact rectangle dimensions, for example
297x210 mm (which is A4 landscape).
 
Go to <i>Object / Fill and stroke</i> and style the rectangle. Remove fill completely
and assign a plain stroke style (eg. 0.5 mm, black).

Run the extension

With the rectangle selected, go to <i>Extensions / Speleo / Layer tricks /
Make a window</i>. Select <i>Clone: Current layer</i> and <i>Layer opacity:
Clone and keep linked</i>. Tick <i>Keep clipping path</i>. Click
<i>Apply</i>.

---
Move to an extra layer

Move your newly created page view to make sure it worked. You should
have a cloned section of the drawing inside your rectangle. Move it
somewhere away from the drawing so that it does not get in the way.

Now create a layer to contain this page (outside of the <i>Drawing</i>
layer!), for example <i>Page 1</i>. With the rectangle selected,
right click on it and select <i>Move to layer</i>. Choose  <i>Page 1</i> as
the target layer.
---
Repeat for other pages

Repeat for subsequent pages. Decorate your page layers with page numbers, a
legend etc. Note that if you change anything in the <i>Drawing</i> layer,
the contents of your pages will automatically update.

Exporting pages to PDF
pages_export.png

To export an individual page into a PDF file, simply make this page the only
visible layer. Then select <i>File / Save a copy...</i> and choose a target
PDF file. An options dialog will appear. Select <i>Output page size: Use
exported object's size</i>.

In a similar way, you can use <i>File / Export PNG image...</i> to export
your pages into raster files.
