<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
<b>Caveink</b> is a set of Inkscape extensions for drawing cave maps.
</p>
<p>
It is developed from my similar, previous project that is already well
tested and has been used to produce many beautiful drawings. However, as of
now, <b>it is still work in progress</b> in an early stage. The functions
described below are there and - principally - work, but need <b>extensive
testing</b>. Any help in that is appreciated. 
</p>

<p>
<u>DISCLAIMER</u>: These extensions have not yet been extensively tested.
It means that all that is described here may not work for you, make your
Inkscape crash or make it run painfully slow. <b>Do not</b> use the
methods described here for any serious work. It is all not yet ready for
that.
</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>
If you are using <i>Microsoft Windows</i>, it is easiest to use the
self-extracting installer: <a
href="download/Inkscape-0.91-1.exe">Inkscape-0.91-1.exe</a>. It installs
both Inkscape <b>and</b> the extensions. Before running it, remove any
former Inkscape versions from your system.
</p>
<p>
As an alternative, you can download just the extensions as a zip file: <a
href="download/caveink-1.0beta2.zip">caveink-1.0beta2.zip</a>. Copy files
from the <i>symbols</i>, <i>patterns</i>, <i>keys</i> and <i>extensions</i>
subdirectories into the relevant directories in your Inkscape installation
directory (could be <i>/usr/share/inkscape</i> or <i>C:\Program
Files\Inkscape</i> or something similar). You also have to install the
<i>SpeleoUIS3</i> font on your system (from <i>fonts</i> subdirectory in the
archive) in order for the line styles to work.
