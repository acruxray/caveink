<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
<b>Caveink</b> is a set of Inkscape extensions for drawing cave maps.
</p>
<p>
It is developed from my similar, previous project that is already well
tested and has been used to produce many beautiful drawings. However, as of
now, <b>it is still work in progress</b> in an early stage. The functions
described below are there and - principally - work, but need <b>extensive
testing</b>. Any help in that is appreciated.

<u>DISCLAIMER</u>: not work, crash, slow
