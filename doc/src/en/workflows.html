<h2>Draw a simple cave map from a paperless survey</h2>
<p>
Import your paperless sketch from <a href="tutorial_the_import.html">PocketTopo</a> or
any other paperless surveying software as a SVG file. Draw a clean copy of your sketch
using standard Inkscape drawing tools, as well as the <a href="tutorial_symbols.html">
symbol library</a>, <a href="tutorial_patterns.html">fill patterns for carpeting areas
</a>, <a href="tutorial_lines.html">line styling</a>
</p>


<h2>Draw a simple cave map from a paper sketch</h2>
<p>
Scan your paper sketch and load it into inkscape. Draw a clean copy using all 
the tools mentioned above. Mark <a href="tutorial_stations.html">where your
stations are on the drawing</a>. Process your survey data using Survex
and <a href="tutorial_3d_input.html">load it into another layer</a>. 
<a href="tutorial_morph.html">Morph your drawing to the real centerline</a>.
</p>

<h2>Collaborate</h2>
<p>
After everyone has finished drawing their section in their own file,
<a href="tutorial_pack.html">combine</a> these files into one SVG document
and <a href="tutorial_merge.html">merge</a> fragments that are not intersecting.
<a href="tutorial_find.html">Find</a> symbols of the same kind and make sure
they are all uniformly styled.
</p>

<h2>Layout and manage complex cave maps</h2>
<p>
Add offset <a href="tutorial_windows_intersect.html">windows</a> to clearly show
intersecting passages on your map. Generate a neat <a href="tutorial_scalebar.html">scalebar</a>
and <a href="tutorial_grid.html">coordinate-annotated grid</a>. 
Split the drawing into <a href="tutorial_windows_pages.html">multiple pages</a> or 
the opposite - <a href="tutorial_windows_projections.html">bring together</a> your plan and elevation
on one page. Should you close a loop or find yourself using the wrong magnetic declination
figure, load a new centerline and <a href="tutorial_rectify.html">adjust</a> your
drawing automatically.
