<h1>For best results...</h1>
<h2>Choose your scale wisely</h2>
<p>
Even in the digital age, we still draw cave maps to scale. Zooming in or out
is very difficult, because the symbols usually have to <i>retain
their sizes</i> independently of the scale.
</p>
<p>
Because of that problem, you need to select your scale carefully at the very
beginning of your work.

<h2>Use fill patterns</h2>
<p>
Generally, the more distinct objects you have in your drawing, the slower
Inkscape responds.
</p>
<p>
With this in mind, if your five kilometer long cave is filled with sand, it is a
very poor idea to indicate that fact with thousands of little circles.
Better use the sand pattern fill. Being only a handful of distinct
objects repeated many times, it is much faster for Inkscape to process!
</p>

<h2>Never embed paper sketches</h2>
<p>
When importing images (such as scans of paper sketches) into Inkscape, you
are always asked whether to just <i>Link</i> to the included file in your
drawing, or rather to <i>Embed</i> the image inside the SVG document. Always
opt for <i>linking</i>! 
</p> 
<p>
It is about how Inkscape extensions internally work. Unfortunately, it is
extremely simple: every time you use an extension, your whole drawing is
saved in a temporary file and then passed to the selected extension for
further processing.
</p>
<p>
Raster files are often very large, and embedding them
into your drawing will result in a large amount of data being packed and
unpacked every time you use one of the <i>Extension / Speleo</i> menu items.
And this essentialy means you will have to wait longer!
</p>

<h2>Remove paperless sketches from your main drawing</h2>
<p>
Importing paperless sketches as vector graphics is very convenient. These
sketches, however, usually contain an enormous amount of data that is not
really useful after the sketch has been traced.
</p>
<p>
I am not suggesting to throw away these sketches! I just say that there is
no point in keeping them in the clean copy file. If you need to fix an error
or re-work something, you still have them in their original files - and you
can always import them again.
