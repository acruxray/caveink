Usage instructions are available at:

Installation instructions:

1. Find your Inkscape shared files directory, try one of the following:
   Windows XP: C:\Program files\Inkscape\share
   Windows 7 or Vista:  C:\Program files (x86)\Inkscape\share
   Linux: /usr/share/inkscape

   You should see a folder with subdirectories named "clipart",
   "extensions", "fonts", "gradients", "icons", "keys" etc.

2. Copy the contents of extensions/ subdirectory of this archive
   into the share/extensions/ subdirectory of your Inkscape installation
   directory.
   
   Copy keys/default.xml from this archive into share/keys/ subdirectory
   of your Inkscape installation directory, overwriting the previous
   file saved under that name.

   Copy contents of templates/ subdirectory of this archive into
   share/templates subirectory of your Inkscape installation directory.

   Do the same for the symbols/ subdirectory.

3. Find your system fonts directory. In Windows, Start / Control Panel /
   Fonts is worth a try. In Linux, try /usr/share/fonts

   Copy the font/SpeleoUIS.ttf file from this archive 
   into that directory.

   Under Windows, you may need to restart your system
   (in case the font cannot be selected)

   Under Linux, you may need to re-generate your font
   cache (sudo fc-cache)
