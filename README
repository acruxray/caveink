DISCLAIMER: This is an early test version! DO NOT use for any big projects. 
Feel free to do lots of testing and to contribute. Any kind of help is welcome.

These extensions add the following features to Inkscape:
- A library of cave map symbols following UIS conventions
- Fill patterns for carpeting areas with rocks/pebbles/sand/clay/silt
- Convenient way of styling "speleo" lines (ie. step/pit, dripline)
- Easy offset "windows" for showing intersecting passages 
- Tools for merging drawings from multiple files
- Morphing drawings to centerlines a'la Therion
- Direct import of centerlines from Survex .3d files
- Import capability for PocketTopo "Therion export" drawings
- Easy generation of scale bars and coordinate-annotated grids

The easiest way to get familiar is to follow the installation guide and some
preliminary tutorials at http://jaskinie.jaszczur.org/caveink-beta1/

caveink has been developed from former work by myself and Thomas Holder
